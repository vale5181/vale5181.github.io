        <h1>Le, Vananh</h1>
        <p>I was born in Vietnam and migrated to the US with my family at the age of 7. As a bilingual, I can fluently speak and write in English and Vietnamese. To this day, I still have yet to learn how to swim. I chose to study Computer Science because my dad had once encouraged me to study engineering. Among all of the engineering field, Computer Science fits me best because it is interesting but also challenging at the same time!</p>
